# Randy Pausch Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams

- Brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things and show our dedication.
- When you’re screwing up and nobody’s saying anything to you anymore, that means they gave up.
- Head-fake: have someone think they are learning something else.
- Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.
- Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress you.
- When you had something for 10 years that you hold so precious, it is the toughest thing in the world to hand it over--find somebody better than you to hand it to.
- The best gift an educator can give: get somebody to become self-reflective.
- Alice has similarities to Scratch, but more focused on storytelling
  - this reminded me of teaching at New York Youth Tech Team, and teaching kids programming using Scratch, with the motivation of creating video games
- A fish giving a talk about the importance of water: “I don’t know how not to have fun. I’m dying and having fun, and I'm going to keep having fun every day I have left, because there’s no other way to play it.
- Never lose the child-like wonder.
  - this reminded me of an essay my friend wrote discussing this topic in particular, and how it made him grow into the person he is today
- Feedback loops and listening to them are important.
- Don’t complain, just work harder.
- Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.
- I wonder what he would think of the virtual reality we have today.
