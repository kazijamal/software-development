v1
Prediction: When any of the table cells are clicked, an alert will be displayed with their innerHTML.
Observation: Prediction was correct.

v2
Prediction: When user clicks on a cell, the pop-ups will appear in the order of the table pop-up, then the row pop-up, and finally the cell pop-up.
Observation: Prediction was incorrect. The order was the cell pop-up, then the row pop-up, and finally the table pop-up.

v3
Prediction: When user clicks on a cell, the pop-ups will appear in the same order as v2.
Observation: Prediction was incorrect. The order was the table pop-up, and finally the cell pop-up, then the row pop-up. This seems to be because of the true parameter in table.addEventListener().

Prediction: When e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, only the table pop-up will be displayed.
Observation: Prediction was correct.
Observation: After removing the true parameter in table.addEventListener() and with e.stopPropagation() uncommented, the cell pop-up is the only one displayed.

v4
Prediction: When user clicks on a cell, the pop-ups will appear in the order of the table pop-up, then the row pop-up, and finally the cell pop-up.
Observation: Prediction was correct.

Prediction: When e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, only the table pop-up will be displayed.
Observation: Prediction was correct.
Observation: The order in which the event listeners are attached does not matter.
