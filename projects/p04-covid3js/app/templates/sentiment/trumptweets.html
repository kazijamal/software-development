      Sentiment analysis on tweets from Donald Trump, the president of the
      United States
    </p>
    <p>
      The following scatterplot shows the sentiment values of Trump tweets
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <div id="scatterplot"></div>
    <p>
      The polarity values on the y-axis range from -1.0 to 1.0, inclusive, where
      -1.0 is most negative and 1.0 is most positive. The range of the x-axis is
      the time between <b>January 1, 2020</b> and <b>April 15, 2020</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following bar chart shows a more discrete perspective of the
      previously shown data, where different ranges are created (in intervals of
      0.2 within the overall range of [-1.0, 1.0]) and the frequency of tweets
      that belong in each range is recorded.
    </p>
    <div id="bar-chart"></div>
    <p>
      Each tweet that is less than or equal to the right endpoint of each range
      is considered to be in that range. For example, if a tweet had a polarity
      rating of 0.0, we would categorize that to be in the -0.2 to 0.0 range. We
      see that the <b>majority</b> of the tweets are
      <b>within the -0.2 to 0.0 range</b>. We also see that the barchart is
      <b>skewed to the right</b>. This means the majority of the tweets are
      positive. However, there are many <b>neutral tweets</b> that are
      <b>rated as 0.0</b> and are <b>counted in the -0.2 to 0.0 range</b>.
