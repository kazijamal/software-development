# Rick and Morty's Minigame Madness by Team qafee 
## Roster and Role:
- Kevin Cai (Project Manager, Director of Authentication)
- Tammy Chen (Intelligence Trivia Agent)
- Kazi Jamal (Lucky Lotto Manager)
- Taejoon Kim (Strength Arena Builder)

## What our website does:
- The overall goal of the project is to create a fun and addictive game for users to play while increasing their stats and building a collection of characters from the television show Rick and Morty. There are multiple minigames to increase stats, including:
  - Intelligence Trivia
  - Lucky Lotto
  - Strength Arena

## APIs utilized:
[The Rick and Morty API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oK0klhp__LHP9kxb3D70cbbI46i1mMnmDMI4y1XS3B4/)
  - We use this API to get the images and names of our characters for our Dashboard page and Lucky Lotto minigame.

[The Open Trivia API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yp2nicOExDYlrEfdvqspD17Kz5c-xMSWHudfmNjJgQ4/)
  - We use this API to get trivia questions for our Intelligence Trivia minigame.
  
[The SuperHero API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6-MBqUFIsfcOkAEePMlcC7ywP8SoCNd4RhlKG4zMjk/)
  - We use this API to get the images and names of enemy characters for our Strength Arena minigame.
