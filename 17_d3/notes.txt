Why does the Let's Make a Bar Chart tutorial use:

// Join the selection and the data, appending the entering bars.
const barNew = barUpdate.join("div");

but 01/index.html uses:

//Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");

Learn D3: By Example

What is a Float64Array? We thought JavaScript was a dynamically typed language, so why is the floating point number type declared?
- The Float64Array typed array represents an array of 64-bit floating point numbers (corresponding to the C double data type) in the platform byte order.

What does d3.randomNormal() do?
- Returns a function for generating random numbers with a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The expected value of the generated numbers is mu, with the given standard deviation sigma. If mu is not specified, it defaults to 0; if sigma is not specified, it defaults to 1.
